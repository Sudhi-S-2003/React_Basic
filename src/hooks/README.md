<h2>What is hooks</h2>
<p>Hooks are special function,that allow us to use state and other React features in functional Compoments.</p>
<p>Earlier,when we used to create react app using functional component,then we didn't have access to the state management and life cycle methods</p>
<p>To access these feature we had to add class components ,so this was the problem with functional component</p>
<p>But After introducing react hooks from version  16.8 ,we can now use statemanagement  and  other react features  without writing  class components.</p>
<i>In other works hooks,are the functions that make functional components work like class components.</i>
